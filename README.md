Please find the original file here http://active-ist.sourceforge.net/jaus++.php?menu=jaus

Description
===========
The Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS), pronounced "jaws", is an emerging standard for communiction with any type of unmanned vehicle that is independent of the technology employed. JAUS++ is an Open Source (BSD) C++ implementation of JAUS (i.e. JAUS SDK) developed by the ACTIVE Laboratory for use in real and simulated unmanned vehicles. This JAUS SDK is designed to support the rapid development of robotics applications, with the current version implementating the SAE Standard (AS5669, AS5710, AS6009), however previous versions (prior to 2.X) support the complete JAUS Reference Architecture 3.3 message set and Node Manager interfaces. It has been heavily tested, and proven to be compliant with other JAUS implementations at events such as the JAUS Interoperability Challenge. This site contains additional documentation to help users get started with JAUS++ that supplements the extensive examples provided with the library.
